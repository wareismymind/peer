# How to contribute

## Submitting changes

When you have an update for us, please send a [GitHub Pull Request](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/) to us with a clear list of what you've done. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    >
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it.

- Identifier names and capitalization for public members should follow [Microsoft standard guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/identifier-names). Private field names within a class should be prefixed by a single underscore.
- Prefer var
- Class structure
- This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them.
